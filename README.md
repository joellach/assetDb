- # Assumptions
  - Asset tracking is global with global coordinates
  - A small percentage of assets are not stationary
  - Queries won't happen for assets that are not in the database
  - The speed of a query is more important than the memory footprint of the database
  - Retrieval system is single threaded but could scale with threads
  - A user is interested in stationary assets to either remove from the database or place in transit
  - A user is interested in non-stationary assets to predict future inventory levels
  - A user will want to query which assets are in a certain area of the world defined by 2 longitude coordinates and 2 latitude coordinates
  - The number of SKUs is much smaller than the total number of assets 10's of thousands verses millions or billions. 
  - IP addresses are statically assigned, fully random, and have no relationship with proximity of assets to each other
- # Design
  - The database consists of 3 nested key:value hash tables that organized by SKU,coordinates, then IP address. Example: assetDb[SKU][Coordinates][IP].  The Coordinates key is the longitude and latitude concatenated together to avoide a hash lookup for both the latitude and longitude.
  - One hash table represents stationary assets, the other represents non-stationary assets.
  - The Longitude and Latitude keys are rounded to the nearest integer representing a search space by the upper left corner Longitude/Latitude intersection
  - To look up a specific IP address, all of the [SKU][Coordinates] hash tables get checked linearly for the existence of the IP.  If the user knows the SKU information, that will speed up the search by 1 hash lookup. If they know the coordinates, that will make it even faster.
  - the AssetDb class will have the following methods
    - constructor : loads the csv file created by the Python scripts
    - query - 
      - All assets in a SKU.
        - query ( string SKU, unsigned int StationaryMask)
      - All assets in a SKU in a region of the world containing these coordinates
        - query ( string SKU , float latitude, float longitude,unsigned int StationaryMask)
      - All assets in a region.
        - query ( float latitude, float longitude, unsigned int StationaryMask)
      - Asset with a specific IP address.
        - query ( string IP )
- # Test
  - The python script create_asset_csv.py creates a csv file of N assets with n random SKUs, random coordinates, 90% of the assetts are not stationary, and random IP addresses.
  - The python script test_asset_csv.py reads in the CSV, tests a query on the SKU, checks the csv file for any oddities that will break the simple C++ parser, checks for unique IP addresses, and implements a rapid prototype of the database retrieval system
- # Improvements
  - Use a standard database like postgress/mySQL
  - encode a unique sub-node index and SKU index into the lower 64-bits of the IPv6 address.  This would reduce the time to generate a hash, reduce collissions, and eliminate the need for nested tables.  The cost would for when the SKU or node would change for a given transmitter we would need to also make a change to the IP address.
  - Add 2 more hash tables(stationary/non stationary) for faster lookup of a specific IP address.  this will save the search through all of the existing SKUs for an IP address
  - Thread the IP address search to look through all of the SKUs in parallel.
  - All Latitude/Longitude boxes are not equal in area Which will create larger search areas near the equator.  Dividing the areas closer to the equator within degres would be better for more accurate tracking near the equator.
  - There is an unordered map in the boost library but I didn't find a speific benefit in my research
  - Give the database query function more powerful regular expressions using the boost library
